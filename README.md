Irssi TMUX Away script with enhancements

This is the tmux_away script for the [Irssi](http://www.irssi.org/) IRC client. 
It was written by Colin Didier and is based on the screen_away
Irssi script by Andreas 'ads' Scherbaum.

This is my version with enhancements, namely it now also works with named sessions (like `tmux new-session -s irc`).

It is hosted at https://github.com/sebastianw/tmux-away
